#Description

This is Stratum Proxy for Vapory based pools (RPCv2) using asynchronous networking written in Python Twisted.
Originally developed for DwarfPool http://dwarfpool.com/eth

**NOTE:** This fork is still in development. Some features may be broken. Please report any broken features or issues.


#Features

* Additional up to 20% increase of earning compared to standard pools
* VAP stratum proxy
* Automatically failover via proxy
* Only one connection to the pool
* Workers get new jobs immediately
* Submit of shares without network delay, it's like solo-mining but with benefits of professional pool
* Central Wallet configuration, miners doesn't need wallet as username
* Support monitoring via email
* Bypass worker_id for detailed statistic and per rig monitoring
* pass submitHashrate to pool

#How it works
```
   Pool A <---+                        +-------------+ Rig1 / PC1
 (Active)      |                       |
               |                       +-------------+ Rig2 / PC2
               |                       |
  Pool B <---+-----StratumProxy  <-----+-------------+ Rig3 / PC3
(FailOver)                             |
                                       +-------------+ Rig4 / PC4
                                       |
                                       +-------------+ Leaserigs

#Configuration

* all configs in file  vap-proxy.conf


#Command line to miner start, recommended farm-recheck to use with stratum-proxy is 200

* ./vapminer --farm-recheck 200 -G -F http://127.0.0.1:8080/rig1


#External script to restart proxy (made by rain)

* https://paste.ubuntu.com/15327007/


# Proxy working check

* To check that proxy works open in browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (or your changed ip and port from config)
* If you see "Vapory stratum proxy" and some infos about connections.
